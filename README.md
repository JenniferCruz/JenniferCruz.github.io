# About this project
This project was completed by Jennifer Cruz for [Udacity's Front-End Development Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001), to cover JavaScript syntax, data manipulation, and some simple jQuery DOM manipulation.
The project's requirements make it so that the resume is built the moment a user opens the website.

## Getting Started
